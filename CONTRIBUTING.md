If you want to contribute, you'll need the following:

Technology, Tools and Licenses:
* JSON (for the supported file format)
* C# / .NET (for the implementation)
* Visual Studio 2017, Community Edition is enough
* [JetBrains Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/), since I want the code to become "green"
* [DevExpress WinForms Controls](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/controls/winforms/)
* [InnoSetup Quick Start Pack Unicode](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
* [Visual Build 9](https://www.kinook.com/VisBuildPro/) for building the whole project

Then, it seems the usual procedure is to fork the repository and make pull requests.
Make sure that an issue exists that describes the problem or enhancement and that it was not rejected before sending the pull request.

By contributing, you agree that your code is released under MIT license, i.e. it can also be used commercially.
